# Realtor.com Filter Coverage Documentation

## Overview

This document catalogs all filters available on Realtor.com with their **URL path segment formats**. Realtor.com uses a **path-based URL encoding** where filters are embedded as additional segments after the location.

All URL patterns documented below have been **verified with live Chrome browser testing** against Realtor.com (Feb 2026). Search types, filters, and equivalence patterns are confirmed via real filter application and URL observation.

---

## IMPORTANT: Value Format Rules

Realtor.com uses **path segments** as its primary filter encoding system, unlike Zillow (JSON query params) or StreetEasy (pipe-delimited).

### URL Pattern
```
https://www.realtor.com/{search-type}/{Location_ST}/{filter1}/{filter2}/...
```

### Filter Encoding Rules

1. **Path Segments**: Each filter is a separate path segment separated by `/`
2. **Key-Value Encoding**: Uses hyphen-based `key-value` format (e.g., `beds-3`, `price-500000-1000000`)
3. **Show Flags**: Boolean toggles use `show-` prefix (e.g., `show-open-house`, `show-recently-sold`)
4. **Property Types**: Uses `type-` prefix with slug names (e.g., `type-single-family-home`, `type-condo`)
5. **Price Ranges**: Uses `price-MIN-MAX` format; `na` for unspecified bound (e.g., `price-na-500000`)
6. **Filter Order Independence**: Filters can appear in any order — the verifier handles all permutations
7. **Case Insensitive**: All URL segments are normalized to lowercase
8. **Sort & Pagination IGNORED**: `sby-*` and `pg-*` segments are stripped

> **Range filters use `key-MIN-MAX`. Use `na` for open-ended: `price-na-500000` (max only), `price-500000-na` (min only)**

### Real Example URLs (Chrome-Verified)

**Price filter:**
```
https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA/price-500000-1000000
```

**Price + Beds:**
```
https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA/beds-3/price-500000-1000000
```

**Price + Beds + Type:**
```
https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA/beds-3/price-500000-1000000/type-single-family-home
```

**Recently Sold:**
```
https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA/show-recently-sold
```

**Open Houses:**
```
https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA/show-open-house
```

## 1. SEARCH MODE & LOCATION

### Search Type
**Location**: URL path (first segment after domain)

| Type | URL Path | Live Status | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| For Sale | `/realestateandhomes-search/` | ✅ Works | Primary search path |
| Rentals | `/apartments/` | ✅ Works | Only functional rental path |
| Sold (Legacy) | `/sold-homes/` | ❌ 404 | Use `show-recently-sold` flag |
| Open Houses (Legacy) | `/open-houses/` | ❌ 404 | Use `show-open-house` flag |
| Individual Listing | `/realestateandhomes-detail/` | ✅ Works | Rejected by verifier (not a search) |
| Mortgage | `/mortgage/` | ✅ Works | Separate page type (not a search) |
| Home Estimate | `/homesestimate/` | ❌ 404 | Not functional |

### Rental Path Aliases (Browser-Verified)

These legacy rental paths all map to the canonical `/apartments/` type:

| Legacy Path | Canonical Path | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| `/rentals/` | `/apartments/` | ❌ 404 on live site — mapped by verifier |
| `/houses-for-rent/` | `/apartments/` | ❌ 404 on live site — mapped by verifier |
| `/apartments-for-rent/` | `/apartments/` | ❌ 404 on live site — mapped by verifier |

### Search Type Equivalences (Browser-Verified)

| Pattern A | Pattern B | Equivalence |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `/sold-homes/City_ST` | `/realestateandhomes-search/City_ST/show-recently-sold` | ✅ Equivalent |
| `/open-houses/City_ST` | `/realestateandhomes-search/City_ST/show-open-house` | ✅ Equivalent |

> The verifier treats these as identical searches. Show flags used for equivalence are removed from filter comparison.

### Location
**Location**: URL path (second segment after search type)

| Scope | URL Path Example | Status |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| City + State | `/realestateandhomes-search/San-Francisco_CA` | ✅ Verified |
| ZIP Code | `/realestateandhomes-search/90210` | ✅ Verified |
| Neighborhood | `/realestateandhomes-search/Mission-District_San-Francisco_CA` | ✅ Verified |
| Multi-word City | `/realestateandhomes-search/New-York_NY` | ✅ Verified |

## 12. NON-SEARCH PAGE TYPES

## 13. SORT & PAGINATION (IGNORED)

These segments are automatically stripped by the verifier — they don't affect search results:

| Segment | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `sby-*` | Sort by | `sby-2`, `sby-6` |
| `pg-*` | Pagination | `pg-2`, `pg-5` |

---

## 14. AUTO-COMPUTED / VERIFIER BEHAVIOR

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Sort ignored** | `sby-*` segments stripped during parsing |
| **Pagination ignored** | `pg-*` segments stripped during parsing |
| **Extra filters allowed** | Agent URL may have MORE filters than GT (noted, not penalized) |
| **Filter order independent** | Filters parsed into dict, order doesn't matter |
| **Case insensitive** | All URLs lowercase-normalized |
| **Protocol/domain flexible** | `http://`, `https://`, `www.` all handled |
| **Equivalence matching** | `sold-homes` ↔ `show-recently-sold`, `open-houses` ↔ `show-open-house` |
